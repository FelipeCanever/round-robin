# Round-robin Scheduling Simulation

This a small and very simple console program simulating the Round-robin scheduling algorithm. It was originally created in C around 2017 as a small college project. This is a rewrite of said program in C++17 and to English (originally in Portuguese).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This is a console-based C++17 application, and, as such, it needs a **C++17 compiler** to be compiled. The project was developed in **Visual Studio 2019**, and that is what you are going to need to open the included project, but **any C++17-compliant compiler should do**.

## Built With

* [Visual Studio Community 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) - The IDE used

## Authors

* **Felipe Canever Fernandes**
